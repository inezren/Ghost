# Ghost
Ghost is a game to add letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to create a valid word. The fragment must be part of an actual word. The user and computer will take turns adding to the fragment. The word has to be at least 4 letters for it to be considered a valid word in this game. The user can choose to challenge the computer if they think that the current word fragment is a valid word or if it is not part of a valid word.
